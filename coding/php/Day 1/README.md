# Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

## *Do you choose to challenge, here are the list of task to be completed in Day 1:*

<br>

1. Write a program that prints 'Welcome to Challenge Yourself To Code In 100 days using PHP programming language' on the console using what you have learnt about the PHP print function.

<br>

2. Look at the code below and copy it to the code editor of your choice for debugging. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡ so that it runs without errors.
```
print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
priint('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```

<br>

3. Write a program that prints the number of characters in "DudgitalSofwareEngineersHub". You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string in PHP.

<br>

4. Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

#3. Ask the user for the second word.
#4. Combine the two words and show them their proposed brand name.
#5. Count the length of characters in the user brand name
#6. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line.
