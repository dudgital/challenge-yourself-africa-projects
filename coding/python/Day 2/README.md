# Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

## *Do you choose to challenge, here are the list of task to be completed in Day 2:*
*Write your codes in try except block*
<br>

1. Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8.

<br>

2. - Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

   - The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

   - The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m): BMI = weight(in kgs)/height*height(in sq meter)

<br>

3. - Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

   - It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

   - You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

   - Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

#### Project of the Day
4. In main.py write a program to build a tip calculator app 
  - If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.   
  - Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
  - Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

```
#Hint: Create three input variables to collect bill amount, number of people spliting bills, and spliting percent from users.

```

Run your code on the terminal
