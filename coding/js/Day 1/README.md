# Working with Variables in Javascript to Manage Data

## *Do you choose to challenge, here are the list of task to be completed in Day 1:*

<br>

1. Write a program to log 'Welcome to Challenge Yourself To Code In 100 days using JavaScript programming language' on the console using what you have learnt about the JavaScript log function.

<br>

2. Look at the code below and copy it to the code editor of your choice for debugging. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡ so that it runs without errors.
```
console.load(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
consle.log("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
consolle.llog('e.g. console.log("Hello " + "world")')
connsole(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```

<br>

3. Write a program that logs the number of characters in "DudgitalSofwareEngineersHub" to the console. You might need to Google for a function that calculates/count the length of a string in JS.

<br>

4. Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

<br>
